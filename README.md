Looking at fifteen years of school modernization funds

In this thread, we are looking to determine vision and scope of the project which was brought to us from 21st Century Schools.

CONTEXT: DCPS has been executing a roughly 15 year, facilities modernization project for DCPS schools (not charter schools) and has spent roughly $9B on upgrades.

PROBLEM: While data on how funds have been spent is available (please see spreadsheet below), it's unclear how the money has been spent and there are questions as to how funds and upgrades have been equitably distributed.

PROPOSED SOLUTION: To create a website with data visualization features that shows how money is currently being spent, on what schools and in what neighborhoods and shows features that communicate future need for improving facilities in the long term. It is the hope of volunteers that the website will be able to persuade council members to distribute funds in an equitable manner.

TIMELINE: Site to go live by February in time for public hearings in March. With a February timeline, we can aim for a public roll out to specific stake holders, elected officials, community members and possibly media.

Potential Features
-heat map of what has been spent
-stream graph


NEXT STEPS:
-brain storm specific features and specific data to be used
-after determining features, group will communicate to volunteer members at 21st Century Schools for approval
-after approval, group will determine tech issues for Code for DC volunteers to execute
